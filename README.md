# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

##  Task

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own.
for this proyect I used [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.
## User
